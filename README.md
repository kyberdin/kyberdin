## About Me

Hi, my name is Stephen Stauts and I am a Firmware and Embedded Systems Engineer.

I have a passion for everything related to embedded systems: firmware
development, hardware and PCB design, robotics, build system tools, and,
most importantly, just building cool things while having fun doing it!

While I use GitHub primarily for open source forks and collaborations,
[my GitLab page](https://gitlab.com/kyberdin) contains more of my personal
projects and group-based repositories.

## Languages

Coming from a firmware background, my core languages are C/C++ and Python,
but I'm always looking to learn more languages and expand my knowledge.
